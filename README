Berry is a minimal web framework written in Python.  It was inspired by
Sinatra.  It is WSGI-compatible and makes use of the HTTP server in Paste.

You can use something like Jinja, etc., for views and Beaker for sessions. Use
nginx or Apache to serve static files.

Example:

  import berry
  from berry import get, redirect

  @get('^$')
  def index(req):
    return "HOME"

  @get('^(\d+)/?$')
  def test(req, id):
    return str(id)
  
  @get('^google/?$')
  def google(req):
    redirect('http://google.com')
  
  berry.start()

Getting form parameters:

  Parameters passed through both GET and POST are stored in request.params.
  Parameters from routes are passed as arguments to the function.

Using middleware:

    berry.use(MyMiddleware, options_dict)

  The WSGI environ variable is available as request.env.

Todo:

  * Better error handling.
  * Include session support natively because it's so common in web apps.
