Berry is a minimal web framework written in Python.  It was inspired by
Sinatra, which is much better.  It has just been rewritten and is no longer
based on CherryPy.

EXAMPLE:

  import berry
  from berry import get, post

  @get('^$')
  def index():
    return "HOME"

  @get('^(\d+)/?$')
  def test(id):
    return str(id)
  
  @get('^google/?$')
  def google():
    raise berry.Redirect('http://google.com')
  
  berry.start()

NOTES.  You can use Jinja2, etc., for views and Beaker for sessions.  Static
file serving hasn't been implemented yet.
