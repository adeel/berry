berry is a minimal web framework written in Python.  it was inspired by
Sinatra, which is much better.

EXAMPLE:

  import berry
  from berry import path
  
  def index():
    return 'Hello, world!'
  path('^/?$').GET = index
  
  berry.start()

NOTES:

  - you can use berry.render for views (uses Jinja2)
  - you can use berry.redirect for redirects
  - berry expects you to have a ./static directory for serving static files,
    but it is not necessary
  - you can import cherrypy and use any of its features
  - feel free to improve
